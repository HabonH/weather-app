# Weather App

## Summary
A single page weather app built with ReactJS part of [#31Days31Videos by Tyler Potts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuA0_Z1llYU). 
Built with ReactJS, Javascript, CSS and HTML.


## What I did different
- Instead of fetch, I used axios to makes calls to a restful [API](https://openweathermap.org/guide) to obtain up to date weather data.
- Refactored the project so that Data and Weather are their own components instead of everything being in the App component.
- Made a responsive design of the project, from only mobile to desktop available as well.

## Setup
Install all dependencies with ```npm install```

To run start web server, use ```npm start```
